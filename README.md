# Snowflake Script Runner

The Snowflake script runner executes multiple SQL statements stored in a table and supports variables.

This project is a Snowflake stored procedure that enables the running of SQL scripts completely inside Snowflake without any external dependencies. It reads and executes SQL statements stored in an ordered table. It also supports replacement variables to increase utility.
